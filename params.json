For this checking, you can download the `sidap_firstRun.R` function for auto checking and installation.\r\n    \r\n        ```\r\n        source(sidap_firstRun.R)\r\n        sidap_firstRun()\r\n        ```\r\n        \r\n        then install the package with following commands:\r\n        \r\n        ```\r\n        install.packages(\"sidap_0.99.5.tar.gz\", repos = NULL, type = \"source\")\r\n        ```  \r\n    * 2.2 check the notes in __sidap_0.99.4__ for package runing    \r\n    \r\n\r\n**sidap_0.99.4** \r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n1.Download this package to your local directory, then start the R session, and change the working directory to where the \"sidap_0.99.3.tar.gz\" is, then\r\ntype the following commands:\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages(\"sidap_0.99.4.tar.gz\", repos = NULL, type = \"source\")\r\n```  \r\n2.Running this package is depended on several other R packages(listed above) which available through Bioconductor. Running the workhorse function `cytof_tsne_densvm`\r\nwill firstly help check if the dependent packages are available, and will ask for user's permission before installing these dependent packages.\r\n```\r\nlibrary(sidap)\r\n?cytof_tsne_densvm   # read the help page for this function\r\ncytof_tsne_densvm()  # input your parameters\r\n```\r\nOtherwise, if you are not comfortable with command, **sidap** provides a user friendly GUI for the workhorse function `cytof_tsne_densvm` in this package.\r\n```\r\nlibrary(sidap)\r\ncytof_tsne_densvm_GUI()\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.Check the help pages for more information about this package and the using of the workhorse function.\r\n              \r\n**NOTE**: This package is in the BETA stage of development, it has been password protected awaiting publication, but will be released as soon as published. New features will continue to be added, please take note for changes in this package. This BETA version is tested on Windows and Mac OS.

For OS X 10.6 and 10.7, the file X11.app should appear in the Utilities folder under Applications in the finder. This application should always be installed under OS X 10.7. For OS X 10.8 or 10.9, the file is named XQuartz.app and is no longer included with the operating system, you need to install XQuartz yourself. Install **XQuartz** from http://xquartz.macosforge.org.\r\n\r\n1. Download the disk image (dmg) file for XQuartz.\r\n2. When you open this file by double-clicking on it, you'll find XQuartz.pkg, double-click on it to run the installer, clicking through all the defaults.\r\n3.
